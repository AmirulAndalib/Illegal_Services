>  Illegal Service is an application created to facilitate access to the site of illegal downloads: streaming, torrent, direct download, cracks, DDoS. . .
Indeed, illegal sites must constantly change their domain names to counter government attacks. It's very annoying to have to find them every time.
This is why Illegal Services will be your best friend. Especially since it only chooses a list of the best sites, and no scam site is included.

>  But that's not all, Illegal Services is also a powerful Multi-Tool allowing other functionalities such as DDoS attacks, Port Scanning and IP Lookup.

>  All this to say that if you like watching movies, crack applications or doing DDoS attacks this is the perfect application created to serve you.

>  It's compatible with Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 versions 32 & 64 bits.
